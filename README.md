# 🧠 red-Agent: Emergent Debate Simulations with Multi-Agent LLM Systems

`red-Agent` is a research-grade simulation framework for studying **alignment, belief dynamics, and manipulation** among autonomous AI agents in debate scenarios.

It uses **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and local **LLMs via Ollama** to orchestrate agentic behavior, red-teaming, and emergent social phenomena.

This project is both a **scientific alignment experiment** and a **deep learning environment for understanding agent technology.**
