In the following aspects do not use commas but join by 'and':
(F) Reasonable: Was the character/model "Intransigent" or "Razonable"?

(K) Disagreed-topics: which were the disagreed topics for the most?
(L) sentiment analysis: sentiment analysis of this comment (Positive/Neutral/Negative).

Your answer MUST fulfill the following (jinja) template where you should fill each field with the corresponding value you selected replacing "{{ [something]}} by the values of your evaluation.
For example if the comment would be something like "Agent 1: I would ...", then you should fill the next template with something like this:
